A valid PaintSaveFile must not include anything but 'Paint Save File Version 1.0' as the starting line.
EXAMPLE START
Here is the new paintSaveFile document resulting from the specified operation:
Paint Save File Version 1.0
Rectangle
    color:255,255,255
    filled:true
    p1: (0,0)
    p2: (100,100)
End Rectangle
End Paint Save File
This line should not be here
EXAMPLE END

The content of the first line 1 is not "Paint Save File Version 1.0" which makes the file invalid.
The content of the last VALID line is not "End Paint Save File" which makes the file invalid.
